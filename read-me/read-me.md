## Description
The Triangle-tracker is a program that can differentiate triangle types based on the side values inputted. It does this by use of Control Flows like IF, IF-ELSE, ELSE statements and Logic Operators like ===, >, <, &&, ||.
Once a user enters input values the program simply tells him/her what kind of triangle it is.

## Behavior Driven Development Process
| Behavior                        |  Input Example |  Output  Example
| User inputs 1 field             | ,,7          | Please input a number!      |

| User inputs ANYTHING NOT a NUMBER  | %,(,#         | Please input a NUMBER! |
| When sum of any 2 sides is <= 3rd side | , 0,0   | That is NOT a triangle |
| User inputs NO equal side,BUT THE SUM OF 2 SIDES IS >THAN THE THIRD SIDE    | 3,4,5         | This is a SCALENE triangle |
| User inputs 2 EQUAL sides                    | 5,5,4         | This is an ISOSCELES triangle  |
